Ok, looks like you need to install google assistant.

Please carry out the following in order to install assistant:
https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/develop/python/config-dev-project-and-account
(you don't need to put it in a raspberry pi...)

With the client_secret JSON file do the following in a terminal:
pip3 install --user google-assistant-library
pip3 install --user google-auth-oauthlib[tool]
google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets /path/to/client_secret_client-id.json --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype --save --headless

Then go to the URL displayed and copy the code, put it back in the terminal.

Thats it, it *should* work now!

Close this file and restart google assistant from the extension. If all is well then this file will not open again. Say "Ok Google" to activate the assistant. Happy assisting!

Good luck!
